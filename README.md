## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I faced a lot of struggle but 2 stood out:
- not knowing where to write HTML + CSS
- was unable to understand the starter README.md file

I immediately went to the discord `help` section and specifically asked these 2 points. The support team there was super helpful and I cant thank them enough.

I still did face a lot of struggle with actually using VS Code and organising the files to see or do any changes. So I had to search how to use VS Code and write HTML + CSS in it.

Interesting pieces of code for me:

```html
<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit' rel='stylesheet'>
```

```css
.card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: var(--white);
    border-radius: 1.5rem;
    width: 23rem;
    padding: 1.3rem;
    text-align: center;
    box-shadow: 0 5px 10px 0 var(--grayish-blue);
}
```

### Continued development

So far I have done the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification and this project.

I will continue on the projects in the discord channel `Challenge-roadmaps` offered by FrontendMentor
